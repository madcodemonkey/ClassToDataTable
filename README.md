# ClassToDataTable

**BETA WARNING...This project is still undergoing changes**

I should be done with most basic changes by the end of the week (February 23rd).

Notes:
- Only reads properties and NOT fields
- It will ignore properties that are arrays or classes

- For some reason SqlBulkCopy is case sentsitive
