 # Creating a DataTable: Creating your own Custom type converter

Custom type converters can be created to handle different types.  If your custom type converter needs some special inputs (e.g., two integers) you may want to start out by creating a new attribute and then creating a converter to pass to it.

Examples
- [Example 1](./TypeConverters-Creating-Custom-Example1.md) - Type converter only with NO custom attribute.
